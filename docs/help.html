<h1>Help Page</h1>

<p>Welcome to Mega Man X Online: Deathmatch! This page gives a comprehensive guide on how to play the game, configure settings, and useful hints/tips to let you pick up your game and kick some reploid butt!</p>

<h2>Installation and updating</h2>

<p>To install for the first time, download the game from the main page of this website. Only Windows is supported, and Windows 10 is recommended. Windows 7 and 8 is somewhat supported but may not work for some users. Unzip the downloaded file and open the MMX.exe file in the folder that gets unzipped to launch the game.</p>

<p><i>Note: You need to download and install .NET 5 if you don't already have it installed. You can download it here: <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime">https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime<a></i>. On this webpage, under the "Run desktop apps" option on the Windows tab, choose "Download x64", "Download x86" or "Download Arm64" depending on your CPU architecture (typically x64 for newer machines on 64-bit Intel processors).</p>

<p>To update the game if there's a new version, download the game again from the main page of this website (the download will always give the latest version). To transfer your settings and controls to the new version, copy these files from your old game version folder to your new game version folder:
  <ul>
    <li>options.txt</li>
    <li>controls.txt</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Game Overview</h2>

<p>In the main Deathmatch mode, the object of the game is to be the first with the most kills, up to a certain amount. If you die, you will respawn in 5 seconds. You can play as one of four characters: Mega Man X, Zero, Vile or Axl. As Mega Man X you can choose from a variety of weapons from the various MMX games, and can carry 3 at a time (unless in 1v1 in which you carry all 9). You can also upgrade your armors using "Scrap", a currency earned in-game on each kill. Various armor parts from the various MMX games are available.</p>

<p>In addition there are other modes available, like Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag and Control Point. In Team Deathmatch the first team whose total kills reaches the kill limit wins. In Capture the Flag, the first team that captures the other team's flag a certain amount of times wins. And in Control Point, Blue team must capture 2 control points on the map before time runs out, while Red team tries to stop them.</p>

<p>From the main menu, you can play online multiplayer by either joining (option 1) or creating (option 2) an online match. You can also play offline with bots only (option 3). Local multiplayer is not supported; all multiplayer must be done online.</p>

<p>Once in a match, you can switch weapons and characters at any time. Press the menu button (ESCAPE) to access the in-match menu to do so. Bear in mind that a switch will kill you if you are alive, possibly crediting a recent damager for the kill, so switch sparingly!</p>

<p>Press the scoreboard button (default TAB) in a match to check the score and what the match is playing to.</p>

<h2>Host Match</h2>

<p>To host a match, follow these steps:<p>
<ol>
<li>Choose "Create Match" in the main menu. The match name will be autogenerated and you can change it by using left/right (although this just autogenerates another random name, you can't type it in manually).</li>
<li>Choose the other settings (map size, map, mode, etc).
  <ul>
    <li>Depending on the map size you choose, a different pool of maps will be available.</li>
    <li>If you only have a few other players or one other player, it's suggested to play on the smaller map sizes, i.e. medium or 1v1.</li>
    <li>You can enable Private Match to make your game not show up in the Join Menu listing to the public. Others will have to manually join in that menu by pressing Menu Secondary button and then type in your match name.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Don't forget to choose your character (X, Zero) and weapons on this screen as well.</li>
<li>Continue to the next screen. You are now on the "Wating for players" menu, and your match is created, and now others can join it by choosing "Join Match" in the main menu.</li>
<li>Once all desired players have joined, you can now press the continue button to start the match. Note that others can join the match later even after it's started.</li>
</ol>

<p><i>Tip: In the Waiting for Players menu, for team modes, you can use the 0-9 keys to toggle players' team assignment, based on their player id number.</i></p>

Note that the host of a match is just another player like the others and still participates in the match with no difference from other players. If the host leaves or disconnects, a new host is promoted in their stead.

<h2>Join Match</h2>

<p>To join a match, choose "Join Match" and select the match name you wish to join. Choose character and weapons. You'll then wait for the host to start their match if it isn't already started.</p>

<p><i>Tip: if you get generic errors when joining or hosting, it could be the match is down. Try again later, or sometimes changing regions can help if it only is one region that is down. Also double check your own network connectivity.</i></p>

<p>Once in a match, you can leave any time and even rejoin. If the host leaves, a random player gets promoted to host. If all players leave, the match is aborted and removed by the match.</p>

<p>When a match ends, the host will have the option to quit the match, or create a new match on the same or different map. If the current host leaves at any time, they will be replaced with a new one.</p>

<h4>A Note on Ping and Region</h4>

<p>Your ping in a match determines the quality of online play. Press the scoreboard button (default TAB on keyboard) to check your ping in a match. Ideally a ping of under 100 is best (the closer to 0 the better), or else hits on enemies as well as their movement will appear very laggy and delayed. </p>
<p>Your region determines where games you host will be created. Currently there are only 3 regions: East US, West US and Brazil. Change your region to the closest region in the settings if it isn't already so that future matches you host have the lowest latency. Join matches in your region for the lowest latency. Note that if you are far away from your opponent, you will also notice their latency, even if you are close to the region.</p>

<p><i>Note: you can play with others in different regions. However, players that are far apart with different preferred regions will encounter higher amounts of latency and a less smooth experience.</i></p>

<h2>Offline</h2>

<p>To play offline against bots, choose the "vs. CPU" option on the main menu, and configure the map settings and your character/weapons.</p>

<p>Note that by pressing F12, you can have your character be taken over by a bot. This works in both Online and Offline modes, so you can use it if you need to go AFK, or even as a way to add extra AI controlled players to an online match.</p>

<h2>Configuration/buttons</h2>

<h3>Controls</h3>
You can change your keyboard controls in the main menu. You can also use a USB controller and change the controls for that. Plug in the controller before launching the game to have the game detect it. Then change the control bindings in the Controls menu.

<h3>Settings</h3>
You can change various settings here, such as sound and music volume, fullscreen options, default windowed resolution, name and region. Note that fullscreen/resolution options require a game restart to take effect. For fullscreen, you can't change the aspect ratio so on widescreen displays black bars may appear on the sides.

<h2>Errors</h2>

If you encounter errors please join the discord at https://discord.gg/kP9XtVU and follow these steps in the FAQ channel:

<p>First check if your issue is in #known-issues channel, if it is, please be patient, it will be fixed in the next game update! If not, please post a bug report in #bugs-and-issues with a detailed description of your issue and your version of Windows. If the game crashes, fails to load, or loads and immediately exits, then please also report the contents of "out.txt" in the main game folder (if it's not empty), in the bug report (be sure to avoid re-opening the game after a crash since every run wipes this file clean.) </p>
