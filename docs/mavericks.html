<h2>Sigma's Maverick Forces</h2>

<div></div><div class="weapon-label">Chill Penguin</div><div class="clearfix"></div>
<img class="mavImg" src="assets/images/mavChillP.png" />
<p class="weapon-stats">
<b>Attack:</b> Shotgun Ice<br>
<b>Special:</b> Ice Breath<br>
<b>Dash Move:</b> Sliding<br>
<b>Ceiling Special:</b> Blizzard<br>
</p>
<p>Chill Penguin provides decent all-around capabilities. His Shotgun Ice can be aimed downwards with DOWN and can block projectiles. His Ice Breath can freeze foes and creates two penguin statues. You can only have two penguins at a time, though you can taunt or slide into them to break your penguin statues. The penguins created can block shots, deals contact damage to enemies, and you can even shove them into foes with the ceiling special, Blizzard (press SPECIAL when near a ceiling in a jump to activate). Blizzard also blows enemies in the direction Chill Penguin is facing. Sliding can quickly move Chill Penguin across the map and he can also jump when using it, and brake with LEFT/RIGHT. </p>

<div></div><div class="weapon-label">Spark Mandrill</div><div class="clearfix"></div>
<img class="mavImg" src="assets/images/mavSparkM.png" />
<p class="weapon-stats">
<b>Attack:</b> Punch<br>
<b>Special:</b> Electric Spark<br>
<b>Dash Move:</b> Dash Punch<br>
<b>Ceiling Special:</b> Ceiling Climb<br>
</p>
<p>Spark Mandrill is all about power. All his moves are highly damaging, though they are slow with high cooldowns. He can also jump on foes to damage them. Spark Mandrill has a special ability, Ceiling Climb, that can be activated by pressing UP when near a ceiling. On certain maps, the extra mobility this provides can be useful.</p>

<div></div><div class="weapon-label">Armored Armadillo</div><div class="clearfix"></div>
<img class="mavImg" src="assets/images/mavArmoredA.png" />
<p class="weapon-stats">
<b>Attack:</b> Head Beams<br>
<b>Special:</b> Guarding<br>
<b>Dash Move:</b> Rolling Shield<br>
</p>
<p>Armored Armadillo excels at defense. His guard can block all damage, and projectiles that deal 3 damage or more can be absorbed and released in a high damage energy blast that returns double the damage back. Rolling Shield is great for both mobility and damaging crowds; when colliding with a wall, hold JUMP to bounce upwards. Armored Armadillo has double defense when hit from behind (much like Vile's back shield) so long as he is wearing his armor. However, if hit with Electric Spark, his weakness, Armored Armadillo loses his armor and guard move, making him less useful defensively.</p>

<div></div><div class="weapon-label">Launch Octopus</div><div class="clearfix"></div>
<img class="mavImg" src="assets/images/mavLaunchO.png" />
<p class="weapon-stats">
<b>Attack:</b> Missiles<br>
<b>Special:</b> Homing Torpedo<br>
<b>Dash Move:</b> Energy Drain (air)<br>
</p>
<p>Launch Octopus packs powerful ranged artillery. His basic missiles can be shot twice in rapid succession to fire two salvos. His Homing Torpedo can cause a full flinch, but has a high cooldown. Both the missiles and the torpedos can damage cracked walls and Frost Shield traps. The whirlpool/energy drain move can only be used in the air above a certain height but is useful for regaining lost health, though it can be mashed out of. Launch Octopus excels on water maps, where he can swim (like Frog Armor) by holding JUMP.</p>

<div></div><div class="weapon-label">Boomer Kuwanger</div><div class="clearfix"></div>
<img class="mavImg" src="assets/images/mavBoomerK.png" />
<p class="weapon-stats">
<b>Attack:</b> Boomerang Cutter<br>
<b>Special:</b> Dead Lift<br>
<b>Dash Move:</b> Teleport<br>
</p>
<p>Boomer Kuwanger is a blindingly fast Maverick that uses his speed to confuse and disorient enemies. His Boomerang Cutter is fast and deals high damage but can't be used again until it flies back to him. It can be aimed with the arrow keys. Dead Lift is a command grab that can launch foes to the ceiling, but Boomer Kuwanger needs his boomerang on his head to use it. Teleport allows Boomer Kuwanger to phase out of existance for a short time and evade all attacks. You can control the direction Boomer Kuwanger teleports, and by how much, by holding LEFT/RIGHT for the appropriate length. You can even teleport through thin walls (such as those in Powerplant).</p>

<div></div><div class="weapon-label">Sting Chameleon</div><div class="clearfix"></div>
<img class="mavImg" src="assets/images/mavStingC.png" />
<p class="weapon-stats">
<b>Attack:</b> Iron Tongue<br>
<b>Special:</b> Chameleon Sting<br>
<b>Dash Move:</b> Cloak/Decloak<br>
<b>Ceiling Special:</b> Spike Drop<br>
</p>
<p>Sting Chameleon is the only Maverick that can climb ladders, making him good on ladder-heavy maps. Not only that but he can even climb any wall in the background by pressing UP, allowing him to reach high foes and map spots easily (press JUMP to go back down). His ability to cloak at any time allows for stealth tactics, though it can only be used four times per life. Iron Tongue can be aimed upwards or downwards and can be used on the ground or while climbing. Activate his ceiling ability by pressing SPECIAL when near a ceiling, to grapple onto the ceiling and shake it, rain a large amount of spikes on the battlefield.</p>

<div></div><div class="weapon-label">Storm Eagle</div><div class="clearfix"></div>
<img class="mavImg" src="assets/images/mavStormE.png" />
<p class="weapon-stats">
<b>Attack:</b> Storm Tornado<br>
<b>Special:</b> Egg Bomb<br>
<b>Dash Move:</b> Diving (air), Gust (ground)<br>
</p>
<p>The only Maverick that can fly, Storm Eagle excels at aerial combat. Storm Eagle's controls are unique in that he doesn't have a jump; instead, us the UP key to rise and fly into the air. Both Storm Tornado and Egg Bomb can be used on the ground or in the air. Pressing DASH in the air takes Storm Eagle into a dive that can deal good damage to foes, and can also be used to cover distance more quickly; press UP when diving to rise back upwards to avoid landing. On the ground, hold DASH to blow a gust of wind that can push foes back.</p>

<div></div><div class="weapon-label">Flame Mammoth</div><div class="clearfix"></div>
<img class="mavImg" src="assets/images/mavFlameM.png" />
<p class="weapon-stats">
<b>Attack:</b> Fire Wave<br>
<b>Special:</b> Oiling<br>
<b>Dash Move:</b> Jump Press (air)<br/>
</p>
<p>Flame Mammoth is a behemoth capable of powerful Jump Press stomps that can even knock enemies off their feet from the shockwave. When combined with Oiling, his fire moves are great at area denial; splash some oil in an area on the map, and then shoot Fire Wave shots onto them to make them explode in a large oil fire that lasts for 8 seconds and deals heavy damage and burn time to anyone unfortunate enough to make contact with the flames. Oiling can also be applied to enemies, making them more vulnerable to fire moves.</p>

<div></div><div class="weapon-label">Velguarder</div><div class="clearfix"></div>
<img class="mavImg" src="assets/images/mavVelG.png" />
<p class="weapon-stats">
<b>Attack:</b> Fire Breath<br>
<b>Special:</b> Ice Breath<br>
<b>Dash Move:</b> Pounce<br>
</p>
<p>Velguarder, Sigma's faithful pet, is unique among Mavericks in that he can climb walls. This gives him extra mobility in maps such as Airport and Power Control. His Pounce is great not only directly against enemies, but as a fast dash that can allow you to quickly cover lots of ground. Pounce can also be used from a wall. However, be careful as Pounce can cause you to accidentally fall to your death, as you can't change direction when it's used. His ice breath can be aimed further with the ARROW keys and you can turn around when using it. As you'd expect, the Fire and Ice breath will burn and freeze, respectively.</p>
