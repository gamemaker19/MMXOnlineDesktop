<h1>FAQ</h1>

<h3>How do I download/play/update?</h3>
<p>Follow the "Installation and Updating" section here: <a href="help.html">help page</a></p>

<h3>What will happen with the web version of the game?</h3>
<p>The old web version at <a href="https://gamemaker19.github.io/MMXOnline">https://gamemaker19.github.io/MMXOnline</a> will remain! But no further development on it will take place and it will not be ported to get online multiplayer.</p>

<h3>Is local multiplayer supported?</h3>
<p>No, it is not currently supported and I do not have plans to add it in, but the old web version above does support it!</p>

<h3>Is LAN supported?</h3>
<p>Currently, no. You must play matches hitting online servers. A future update may add LAN if there's enough demand.</p>

<h3>Will you add more gamemodes?</h3>
<p>I plan to add team deathmatch, CTF and elimination (deathmatch with 1 life only) in a future update if there's enough demand!</p>

<h3>Will you add vehicles (Ride armor, Ride chaser)?</h3>
<p>This is another future possibility that fits with my vision of the game! Not all maps would support them, of course.</p>

<h3>Will you add more weapons?</h3>
<p>I feel that adding more weapons would break the already delicate balance of having 18 different types of attacks from X (including both non-charged and charged variants of the 9 weapons). And this would be a lot of work and would clutter the menus. So I want to focus on making the original, iconic 9 weapons as polished and balanced as possible!</p>

<h3>Will you add more characters? (i.e. Mavericks/Vile/Sigma/Axl/etc)</h3>
<p>As I envisioned MMX Online: Deathmatch to be more focused on the strategy of dynamic weapon configurations and ability interactions, I do not plan on adding more characters to the game. Zero was added to provide more variety and a melee character that does not involve swappable weapons/abilities, so I believe all character archetypes are already covered. Besides, the duo are iconic in the series, and I feel that having more characters belittles their central role in the series!</p>

<h3>Will you port to mobile?</h3>
<p>Right now there are no plans to do this. The game was not written in an engine that would allow easy porting. Also, controls wouldn't be great on Mobile!</p>

<h3>Why are opponents so jittery/laggy in online matches?</h3>
<p>Players not close to one of the 3 regions (West US in California, East US in Virginia, Brazil in Southern Brazil) will have increasingly higher latency the farther away they are from these regions. Try playing with players closer to your region/one of the regions for a smoother experience.</p>
