<h1>Version 16.2</h1>

<p>Asset Changes? No</p>
<p>Relay Server Update? No</p>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Removed X preferred armor option as it's no longer used. This fixes a crash in the character select menu if this option was set to X2 or X3.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Sting Chameleon couldn't climb all the way up ladders.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the Wait Menu where the map name was displaying the match name.</li>
<li>Fixed command grabs not working offline.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Chill Penguin could not break ice statues with taunt.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Rekkoha pillars and Wolf Sigma in Large Camera mode would not spawn at the right Y position.</li>
<li>Fixed a cooldown exploit with Nova Strike.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where in 1v1, any player was able to join the battle when the fight has already started. Now they will be moved to spectate.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where neutral Ride Armors would recover all HP when changing owners.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Giga Crush/Nova Strike directional inputs could allow X to shoot weapons in the death animation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Balance changes</h3>

<p>General</p>

<ul>
<li>Giga Attack ammo gain now proportional to max health. The greater the max health, the less giga ammo granted on damage taken.</li>
<li>Reworked scrap awarding system:
  <ul>
    <li>Now works based on multiplicative modifiers. The base scrap earned is dependent on how far behind you are and can be 1-3 scrap per kill (as with before).</li>
    <li>Killing a Maverick increases the base modifier by 2x (as with before).</li>
    <li>Killing a player with 4 or more heart tanks (24 or more life bars) now increases the base modifier by 2x.</li>
    <li>Killing a 5 scrap Hyper Mode (Golden X, MK-II, etc) now increases the base modifier by 2x.</li>
    <li>Killing a 10 scrap Hyper Mode (UP/UAX, Black Zero, etc) now increases the base modifier by 3x.</li>
    <li>These modifiers can stack. For example, if heavily behind and you kill an 8 heart tank Black Zero, the raw scrap gained is 3x2x3=18 scrap.</li>
    <li>Remember, the existing 15 scrap limit (which prevents hoarding) still applies. If over 15 scrap you will always earn 1 scrap per kill. If under 15 scrap you can only gain enough to go up to 15.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Zero</p>

<ul>
<li><img src="../assets/images/nerf.png" class="nerf" title="nerf"/>Rekkoha ammo usage reverted to 32 bars.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sigma</p>

<ul>
<li><img src="../assets/images/buff.png" class="buff" title="buff"/>Summoner: no longer will issue attack move command when dashing, which should help prevent accidental attack moves.</li>
<li>
  <img src="../assets/images/buff.png" class="buff" title="buff"/>Added a new scrap gain ability exclusive to Sigma called "War Economy":
  <ul>
    <li>Each Maverick in Sigma's loadout not yet purchased and deployed to combat will fund Sigma's war efforts behind the scenes, providing 1 scrap every 10 seconds.</li>
    <li>This ability does not apply to Striker Mode since Mavericks in this mode are always considered "deployed".</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
