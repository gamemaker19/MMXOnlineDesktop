<h1>Version 9.5</h1>

<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Can now use mouse scroll to switch Axl weapons.</li>
<li>Locked down some asset files (level and sprite JSONs) that could easily be modified/tampered with on client side for cheating/disruption purposes in online matches.</li>
<li>The list of game sounds is now hard-coded in the application and no longer trusts the contents of the sound folder which is easily modified/tampered with client side. Modding existing sound file contents is still possible but there is no longer any risk of messing up behavior for others in online matches by renaming/adding/removing files.</li>
<li>If the find match menu, or the private match lookup prompt, cannot fetch matches from a region due to a network error, it will now display an error message for that region instead of silently failing.</li>
<li>Reworked netcode to be more bandwidth efficient.</li>
<li>To prevent some major desync issues, if the current host leaves, all bots are removed from the match. The new host can re-add bots back in if they wish.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Waiting for host menu was made more resilient to desyncs and should reduce instances of "ghost matches".</li>
  <li>Fixed some issues with palette shader on certain GPU architectures.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in 1v1 where both players could spawn in the same spot.</li>
  <li>Removed some bad music files in assets/sounds folder.</li>
  <li>Fixed issues with certain maps where X could get under the stage, especially water maps with Bubble Splash.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where the bot indicator wasn't appearing on the scoreboard in team modes.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where Hawk ride armor could hover above the stage indefinitely.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where Goliath dash attack would crash into slopes.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where charged Fire Wave only used 2 ammo instead of the intended 8.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where one of X's gloves would not become blue when crouching if the Light Armor buster was upgraded.</li>
  <li>Fixed a fast wall climb exploit that could be performed if holding left and right at the same time.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where Ray Splasher turrets would show self damage text when shooting.</li>
  <li>Fixed dinging sound if hit with charged Gravity Well while invincible.</li>
  <li>Patched up a hole in Forest and Forest2 maps' ceiling bounding boxes.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where Vile Ride Armor could stomp/kangaroo charge/shoot goliath shots while in invuln frames.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where Axl could charge while in invuln frames.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where Axl bots could switch to Double Bullet even without White Axl.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Balance Changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Gravity Well: Uncharged shots now attract enemies in the y-axis in addition to the x-axis, meaning that it will be harder to suck enemies into pits with the wells.</li>
  <li>Gravity Well: Charged shot duration reduced from 5 seconds to 2 seconds. X is now immobile and vulnerable during the duration of the cast.</li>
</ul>
