  <h3>Mega Man X Character Guide</h3>

  <img src="assets/images/X1.png" width="200"/>
  <div class="bio" style="width:1000px">
    <h4>Bio</h4> 
    <p>Mega Man X is the eponymous protagonist of the Mega Man X series. He was the successor of the original Mega Man and is Dr. Thomas Light's greatest creation. X is a Maverick Hunter who fought alongside his partner Zero in order to maintain peace and stability in the world and protect humans and Reploids alike from Maverick Reploids, though X would like nothing better than the opportunity to stop fighting.</p>
    <img src="assets/images/ssx1.png" />
  </div>

  <h4>Gameplay/abilities</h4>
  <p>X is the game's main ranged trooper. His primary attack is shooting whatever weapon he currently has equipped. By holding down the attack key, you can charge your weapon. Keep in mind that all special weapons (except the X-buster), run on limited ammo, so place your shots wisely. However, all maps have infinitely respawning ammo pickups available where you can refill your supply.</p>
  <p>Also keep in mind that having a weapon equipped makes you weak to a specific other weapon! This weapon corresponds to boss weaknesses in the real game, so for example if you have shotgun ice equipped you will be weak to fire-wave and take double damage from it! 
  Note that the X-buster does not have any weakness.</p>
  <p>X can dash, jump and climb, like in the real games. He can also do an air dash. However, unlike Zero, he lacks a double jump.</p>

  <h4>Weapons</h4>
  <p>In non-1v1 modes, X can carry up to 3 weapons at a time and switch weapons in the in-game menu. Note that the X-buster is not mandatory but recommended in the first slot because of its infinite ammo.</p>
  <p>See the weapon guide here for a guide to X's arsenal: <a href="weapons.html">Weapon Guide</a></p>

  <h4>Armors</h4>
  <p>X can use Scrap (a currency earned on each kill) to purchase armor upgrades in the in-game menu. Different armor sets from the various SNES games are available. You can even mix armors from the different armor sets, though you won't be able to take advantage of set bonuses unless you equip all 4 armor pieces in the same armor set.</p>
  <p>See the armor guide here for a complete guide to X's upgrades: <a href="armor.html">Armor Guide</a></p>

  <h4>Strategy/remarks</h4>
  <p>As X, you are a generalist and the game's primary frontline soldier. In team modes, you form the backbone of a solid team with a reliable ranged weapon that can take out opponents at range and even off-screen. In FFA modes, you play aggressively yet carefully, keeping your distance from Zero and other X's, and retreating when necessary.</p><p>In general, X is extremely versatile, with a vast array of special weapons and armor available to choose form depending on the situation. As X, you should constantly evaulate the flow of the game, considering which weapons allies or enemies have equipped, whether a flag needs to be defended from heavy attack, or the distribution of characters on your team or the other. Overall a more strategic, defensive tactician.</p>

  <h4>X matchup</h4>
  <p>When fighting another X, weapon weaknesses are key. Because certain weapons do double damage to other weapons, you'll want to pick a good variety of weapons that can cover each other's weaknesses, and switch out if you are weak to a foe's weapon. In certain cases it is possible to fight against a weakness, such as if they are low on health and there are other foes nearby actually weak to your weapon, but generally it's not recommended.</p><p>Another thing you should keep in mind is your current health and ammo, and theirs possibly. If you are low on health it is ill-advised to fight a head-on battle. You should use charged shots, playing defensively, try to pick them off with off-screen shots, as you search for health. The same applies for low ammo situations. Note that if you have even one bar of ammo left, you can still do a charge, so make use of this tip as much as possible to squeeze out the most use of your remaining supplies!</p>
  <h4>Zero matchup</h4>
  <p>Zero was designed as an aggressive melee attacker while X is more of a ranged defender. As such, you should attempt to "kite" a charging Zero whenever possible (dash/retreat out of his melee range, quickly turn around and shoot, and repeat), especially with charged shots that will cause him to flinch, buying time. As mentioned previously, the foot parts are useful as they allow you to match Zero's speed and therefore maintain your distance while kiting. Watch out for ambushes from above or below, as Zero is very scary if he can get in your face unexpected. Storm Tornado is also effective - blow him away, then switch to another weapon and pepper him with shots while he's being kept back.</p><p>Bear in mind that Zero can reflect many of your projectiles (!) with his Z-Saber so avoid the X-buster, Chameleon Sting, Electric Spark, Shotgun Ice or Hadouken whenever possible. The last thing you want is to spend time charging a shot, only for it to come straight back and take you down!</p>
  <h4>Vile matchup</h4>
  <p>The most important thing to remember when fighting a Ride Armor Vile is to aim for his head. As X, depending on your weapon, you may need to jump for this. Weapons that can hit at flexible angles or home in on their targets are generally more effective against Vile, such as Homing Torpedo (which homes in on Vile's head). The foot armor parts also will help in outrunning him from his punch range. Always make sure you're out of Vile's punch range, and kite a charging Vile similar with how you would fight Zero. Once you're fully upgraded, a Hadouken will destroy the Ride Armor in one clean hit, leaving Vile vulnerable to being finished off. Remember that the Rolling Shield doesn't block melee attacks like Vile's punches or stomps, but it will guard against his stun shot and bombs. Finally, one of the most valuable weapons against Vile is the Strike Chain as it can yank him straight out of the Ride Armor. If a good Vile is causing trouble, don't hesitate to switch to this weapon.</p>
  <h4>Axl matchup</h4>
  <p>Axl is similar to X in that he is a ranged character, and so unlike with Zero and Vile opponents, kiting is not really an option. Axl's main difference is his lack of raw power per shot but makes up for this with much better aiming capabilities and rapid fire attacks. X can be a difficult target for Axl to hit due to his small hitboxes, so try to dash and jump as much as possible so he cannot effectively lock on to you. Avoid standing still even for a brief second as this will allow him to get a burst of gunfire on you. You'll want to combine fast and unpredictable movement with close range dives into his face accompanied with a charge shot - up close and personal, Axl has difficulty hitting his targets due to his minimum range. For this reason, the Fire Wave is also an effective Axl counter. However, watch out for Blast Launcher as that does not need to be aimed to hit you.</p><p>Foot and body armor parts help the most, the former for the fast movement to evade gunfire, and the latter to more effectively tank Axl's rapid fire onslaughts. Consider Rolling Shield when fighting Axl, as it will effectively block his Axl Bullets (but is not as effective against the Blast Launcher).</p>

  <h3>Zero Character Guide</h3>
  <img src="assets/images/zero.png" />
  <div class="bio" style="width:900px">
    <h4>Bio</h4>
    <p>Zero is the deuteragonist of the Mega Man X series. He is the successor of Bass and the greatest creation of Doctor Albert W. Wily. A high ranking Maverick Hunter and legendary freedom fighter, he's a die-hard warrior who doesn't hesitate to take action. However, behind his cold and emotionless attitude lies a wounded soul.</p>
    <img src="assets/images/ssx2.png" />
  </div>
  <h4>Gameplay/abilities</h4>
  <p>Zero is the game's main close-ranged specialist. His main attack is a sword swing. Press the attack buttons 3 times in succession on the ground to do a melee combo; the third hit in the combo causes a full flinch and deals extra damage. You can also attack when dashing to do a dash attack, good for closing in on enemies and damaging them at the same time. Midair attacks are also possible.</p>
  <p>In addition to all of X's movement abilities, Zero can also double-jump when in the air, but only if he has not already dashed in mid-air, and double-jumping will prevent a following mid-air dash.</p>
  <p>Finally, keep in mind that Zero's sword swings and guard ability can even reflect projectiles shot by X! The X-Buster (all charges) can be reflected, as can uncharged Chameleon Sting, Electric Spark, Shotgun Ice and Hadouken.</p>
  <h4>Special techniques</h4>

  <p>Zero can activate several special techniques with the "Special" button (default D on keyboard).</p>

  <p>Raijingeki ("Thunder God Attack")</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Controls: Special button on ground</li>
    <li>Damage: 2 per hit (8 hits max)</li>
    <li>Description: Zero electrically charges his Z-Saber and thrusts it forward, dealing massive damage to anyone hit by it. The closer the victim is to Zero, the more hits will be inflicted. However, this move is quite slow and leaves you open, so use it carefully. A faster but weaker purple colored variant can also be chained after the first or second swing of the Z-Saber combo.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Ryuenjin ("Dragon Flame Blade")</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Controls: Up + Special button on ground</it>
    <li>Damage: 4 per hit (2 hits max), applies 2 seconds of burn</li>
    <li>Description: Zero performs a flaming uppercut with his Z-Saber, damaging and burning enemies it hits. This is great for hitting enemies above you and enemies in the air while simultaneously gaining height. But bear in mind, it can't deal damage underwater.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Hyouretsuzan ("Ice Fury Slash")</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Controls: Down + Special button in air</li>
    <li>Damage: 4</li>
    <li>Description: Zero thrusts his Z-Saber down, encases it in ice, and falls straight down to the ground, freezing any foes hit by it for 2 seconds max. This can be mashed out of rather quickly, however.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Rakuhouha ("Falling Feng Crush")</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Controls: Down + Special button on ground</li>
    <li>Damage: 4 per energy ball</li>
    <li>Description: Zero punches the ground, radiating 9 energy balls in a fan shape from his position. Zero also becomes invincible for the duration of the move. This move runs on an ammo meter that fills as Zero takes damage. It costs half the entire bar, so it can only be used sparingly.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Shippuuga ("Hurricane Fang")</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Controls: Special button while dashing on ground</li>
    <li>Damage: 2</li>
    <li>Description: This is a special dash attack that deals less damage than the normal dash attack and has a smaller hitbox but it will cause a flinch on hit. Follow up with an attack of your choice for an effective combo.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Kuuenzan ("Air Circling Slash")</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Controls: Special button in the air</li>
    <li>Damage: 2</li>
    <li>Description: This air attack will cover an area all around Zero, but deals less damage than the normal air attack. Consider using underwater where the Ryuenjin is ineffective.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Guard</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Controls: Weapon Left or Weapon Right (Default A or S on keyboard)</li>
    <li>Description: Zero holds his Z-Saber in front of him, reflecting projectiles that can be reflected, as well as reducing damage by half from hits that cannot be reflected. It also removes all forms of knockback and can deflect other Zero's Z-Saber swings.</li>
  </ul>

  In addition, some of these techniques have "alternate" versions that can be activated with ATTACK btn instead of SPECIAL. These are below:

  <p>E-Blade (Electric Blade)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Controls: Up + Attack button on ground</it>
    <li>Damage: 3 per hit</li>
    <li>Description: Zero performs an electrical uppercut with his Z-Saber. Unlike with Ryuenjin, it flinches, and deals a larger amount of lower damage hits. However it's got a smaller hitbox, so space your attack more carefully. Also unlike its fiery cousin, it can actually deal damage underwater, so it's your only option of the two in water maps.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Rakukojin ("Falling Steel Edge")</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Controls: Down + Attack button in air</li>
    <li>Damage: 4+</li>
    <li>Description: Zero's Z-Saber becomes a large metal sword, and he drops straight down to the ground with it, dealing serious damage to anything it strikes. Though it can't freeze like the Hyouretsuzan, it deals more damage the higher the height Zero drops from, up to a whopping 14 max if you land from over 2 screens above. Note that if Zero's fall speed is slown down (i.e. he's underwater), the move deals less damage.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Zero also has a ranged weapon: the Zero Buster. To fire it, hold down the ATTACK button to charge and then release. It's stronger than the X-Buster, but each shot consumes one scrap, so you can only use it sparingly. It's a great approach option for stunning enemies before closing in on them, but if you use it excessively, you'll lose out on the Black Zero upgrade, so weigh your options carefully. When playing with a lower amount of players, it can be more useful than Black Zero since the latter may only net you one or two kills before your armor runs out, less than what 10 Zero Buster shots could likely accomplish, assuming your aim is good and you can land those shots.</p>

  <p>Finally, Zero has a "hyper" mode where he can transform into Black Zero for the cost of 10 scrap. To activate this ability, hold down the attack button to charge and release to transform into Hyper Zero for 10 seconds. While transforming you are invincible. While you are Black Zero:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All attacks will deal 1.5x damage and flinch.</li>
    <li>Movement speed is increased.</li>
    <li>You cannot flinch yourself from attacks.</li>
    <li>You can unleash the mighty Rekkoha technique. To do so, simply use Rakuhouha with a full ammo meter. This move is a powered up Rakuhouha that fires light beams that rain down on foes in the whole screen; it's sure to cause some serious damage and cleanup if you can pull it off.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Strategy/remarks</h4>
  <p>As Zero, you are an aggressive close-quarters-combat and ambush character. You close in on your opponents and quickly dispatch them with combos from the high-damaging z-saber. In team modes, you charge in the battle and let your X allies shoot unimpeded. In FFA modes, you relentlessly hunt down other maverick hunters, ambushing whenever possible to prevent retreats.</p>
  <p>As Zero, you should understand how each of your techniques work and string together combos whenever possible. For example, one good combo is Ryuenjin into Hyouretsuzan, as the former will bring Zero into the air and allow for a setup into the latter. You can then further combo the frozen enemy with a standard 3-slash attack, or if you're feeling lucky, a Raijingeki (though foes can mash out of the freeze if they're quick enough and aren't low on HP.) Another combo is Shippuuga into anything, taking advantage of the flinch to close in on foes more easily. You can also Rakuhouha aerial foes, bringing them down to the ground with the flinch, and catch their landing with a powerful move like Raijingeki, a 3-slash combo, or even another Rakuhouha!</p>
  <p>Your Guard is great for tanking powerful hits like charged shots and can even reflect projectiles and deflect z-saber swings. In addition, the Guard is great for filling Rakuhouha charge since it reduces damage by half from all hits taken, but the Rakuhouha charge rate on hit is the same. However, don't overuse it, since every second spend guarding is less time dishing out damage and getting kills, and as Zero was designed for lightning-fast offense, the best defense can frequently be a relentless offense. Also considering subsituting Guard for Rakuhouha when you have enough ammo for it since it prevents all damage instead of just reducing it by half.</p>
  <p>Zero is more of a "glass cannon" archetype than X. He cannot upgrade his health at all, so becomes weaker as the game progresses. That being said, his Guard and Rakuhouha can make up for his frailty, as can also be said for his extremely high damaging moves - if you can finish foes before they can even have time to attack you, his low health becomes less of an issue.</p>
  <p>Overall Zero is a powerful character, but he does take some skill to use, like in the real games.</p>
  <h4>X matchup</h4>
  <p>X has "limitless potential", which means that he gains strength as the match progresses. On the other hand, Zero starts off strong, but cannot upgrade like X can, so you'll want to be wary of fully upgraded X's in the late game. In general, Zero is superior to an unupgraded X but inferior to a fully upgraded one. As such, you'll want to use your Hyper Mode whenever possible to deal with a full armor X and match his power.</p><p>Fighting X can be a high-risk, high-reward endeavor. On one hand, if he sees you coming, he can simply dash away and shoot repeatedly. If he has the foot armor parts, he can do this without even being hit by you. On the other hand, if you can quickly or unexpectedly get in range you will eliminate him fast. Try to ambush from above, below or behind. Sandwiching an X with a zero ally, or cornering an X, can also be devastating.</p><p>Consider trying to reflect an X's projectiles if he is using a reflectable special weapon and causing problems with it. Only attempt this at a distance, since doing it at point-black will not work, and the timing is more challenging the closer you are. Slow projectiles fired off-screen are easier to reflect and should be reflected whenever possible. Consider going after X's with reflectable weapons as this makes them weaker to you. If an X is attempting to charge their weapon, attack until they are close to complete, then back off, and attempt to reflect or bait out the charge whenever possible. Also remember, you can reflect Hadoukens, so in the late game, always be expecting it, and try to predict/or bait the move so you can get a quick reflect kill on X!</p>
  <h4>Zero matchup</h4>
  <p>Zero vs Zero is a battle of skill, spacing and timing. If your sword clashes with an enemy Zero's, they will block each other and cancel out. Whoever can better space and time their attacks and pull off faster sword swings will generally prevail. Bear in mind your guard will deflect another Zero's standard attacks, but they won't prevent damage from his special techniques (with the exception of Rakuhouha projectiles, which will be reflected as usual).</p>

<h4>Vile Matchup</h4>
<p>Viles in Ride Armors are bad news. The Z-Saber is a fast and damaging weapon, but against the Ride Armor's hulking metal fists, it gets nullified quite easily, and you'll tend to lose melee exchanges against the Ride Armor's punches. Therefore, avoid frontal sword assaults on the ground. Z-Buster shots aimed at the head from a safe distance work great if you have enough scrap. If not, try double jumps to get on top of Vile and then freeze him with Hyouretsuzan. Follow up with a Ryuenjin followed by another Hyouretsuzan, or air attacks. Sometimes, the Raijingeki can work as well on an unsuspecting Vile, and will deal massive damage to his Ride Armor. If you're on a ledge and can hit his head with the move, even better.</p>
<p>Outside of his mech, Vile is less of an issue for Zero. Just watch out for stun shots when closing in on him, as they will go through your guard and can't be reflected. Vile MK-II has some more powerful abilities and his grab can go through your guard, so be vigilant when fighting his upgraded form.</p>

<h4>Axl Matchup</h4>

<p>Zero can be an effective counter to Axl. All of Axl's attack except for Explosion can be reflected, so if under heavy gunfire, do not hesitate to guard. You'll also reflect his bullets if you swing your sword. Just remember you need to face him and it won't work at point blank. But if Axl tries to get at point blank or run behind you, you can tear him to pieces with the Z-Saber at melee range. Try to close in on Axl whenever possible and get up close and personal as he will have difficulty hitting targets at close range due to his minimum range on most of his weapons. Also remember that Axl cannot shoot through walls, so try to place a wall or cover between you and Axl if you're getting pestered by gunfire when dealing with other threats, or when closing in.</p>

<p>One thing to watch out for is an Axl shooting at you when you're pre-occupied with another fight. In this scenario, Axl can get a lot of shots on you uncontested. If you're in a fight and an Axl comes along, consider abandoning the fight and going after Axl unless you're close to winning. Otherwise Axl can shoot you in the back while you're swinging your sword or performing techniques, which leaves you standing still and vulnerable. For this reason, you should also avoid slow, laggy techniques like Raijingeki vs Axl as they make you a very easy target to lock on to. Try to constantly dash and move and use quick air attacks to close in the distance and block his bullets more easily.</p>

  <h3>Vile Character Guide</h3>
  <img src="assets/images/vile.png" />
  <div class="bio" style="width:880px">
    <h4>Bio</h4>
    <p>Vile is a major antagonist in the Mega Man X series. He used to be a member of the Maverick Hunters and was ranked S-A Class in Sigma's 17th Elite Unit prior to his commander's rebellion against humanity. Due to being a borderline Maverick, he was removed from duty and detained, being freed during Sigma's rebellion so he can cause as much destruction as he wishes.</p>
    <img src="assets/images/ssx3.png" />
  </div>
  <h4>Overview</h4>
  <p>Vile is rather unique among characters in that he can summon and command various Ride Armors with his third weapon slot. Ride Armors have higher HP than Vile and can take hits for him; however, be careful, as enemies can aim at your exposed head in the cockpit seat to deal damage directly to Vile, who only has 16 bars of health.</p>
  <p>Vile does not spawn with any Ride Armors and it costs 5 scrap to summon a Ride Armor, so he must progress thorugh a match and earn kills before calling down the big guns. He comes with three switchable weapons: the Front Runner, the Vulcan and the aformentioned Ride Armor slot. In addition, SPECIAL button activates many secondary abilities, which tend to be debilitating traps and bombs that provide effective support for his regular weapons.</p>
  
  <h4>Weapons</h4>
  <p>Vile can switch between two capabile weapons in slot 1 and slot 2. These weapons, in addition to his specials, will never run out of ammo. (He carries plenty of the stuff on his back, after all.)</p>

  <h5>Front Runner (3 damage)</h5>
  <p>A powerful shot that Vile fires from his shoulder cannon. It can be aimed upwards at two different angles: 60 degrees (hold up) or 30 degrees (hold forward + up). It can even be fired in the air, where it can be aimed upwards or downwards at 30 degrees, and when wall sliding and climbing. Overall this weapon is great for anti-air, kiting enemies, and otherwise hitting enemies at odd angles, but it's raw damage isn't the highest.</p>

  <h5>Vulcan (1 damage per bullet)</h5>
  <p>Vile's iconic and deadly finger cannon. It shoots very rapidly and deals a high rate of fire, but can only shoot straight ahead. It's best unleashed on grounded threats. Stun your enemy first to ensure the most damage, and to prevent Zero from reflecting the bullets.</p>

  <h4>Specials</h4>
  <p>Vile's special moves can be activated with the SPECIAL button and can be used in conjunction with his normal weapons as effective support abilities.</p>

  <h5>Ground Neutral Special: Stun Shot</h5>
  <p>A slow moving ball of electricity that will stun enemies for two seconds if it hits. It's fired from Vile's shoulder cannon and so can be aimed at the same angles as the Front Runner. </p>

  <h5>Ground Special + Forward: Rocket Punch (3 damage)</h5>
  <p>Vile launches his fist at enemies to teach them a lesson. The fist moves very quickly and applies a full flinch, but leaves Vile vulnerable until it returns to his arm. Hold the shot down to make the fist go further; if held down for the full time, this move has the most range of any Vile weapon.</p>

  <h5>Ground Special + Down: Napalm Grenade</h5>
  <p>Vile ejects a grenade from his knee. The explosion deals two damage and spews hot napalm in an area, dealing an additional 1 damage over time if opponents are standing in the hot substance. Effective for area denial. Combine with the stun shot to ensure opponents stay in the Napalm for longer.</p>

  <h5>Air Neutral Special: Air Bombs (2 damage)</h5>
  <p>Vile releases two bombs from his knee that drop downwards and split into two faster moving projectiles. This is an effective move for hitting enemies directly below you where the Front Runner couldn't reach.</p>

  <h4>Ride Armor Types</h4>
  <p>Vile can choose between 4 different Ride Armors to summon in weapon slot 3. Once you've summoned a mech, use this weapon slot to recall it to your location at any time when you are out of the mech.</p>

  <h5>Normal Ride Armor (N-Type)</h5>
  <p>This is Vile's standard, trusty Ride Armor used in MMX1. It's the most well-rounded mech, combining power, speed and mobility. Vile's primary attack button is punching with the mech. This move comes out surprisingly fast and deals 3 points of damage with a full flinch, but it has a rather short range. You can also jump on enemies to deal damage to them as well. You can also dash in the mech. Press the down arrow key in the mech to duck and hide inside of it, which will fully protect Vile himself from all damage, but causes the ride armor to become stationary (but you can still punch). Also while ducking in his Ride Armor, Vile can toss the Napalm grenade out of his mech with SPECIAL key, similar to outside of it when crouching. Finally, Vile can shoot his stun cannon while in the Mech (but not ducking inside it) with the SPECIAL key. This move stuns enemies for 2 seconds but can be mashed out of. Stun enemies to ensure they can't run away from the slow speed and melee range of the mech.</p>

  <h5>Kangaroo Ride Armor (K-Type)</h5>
  <p>A slower but stronger Ride Armor. Its spiked fists deal a full 6 damage on hit but swing slower than the normal Ride Armor. The punch can also be charged to fire a chain attack that can attack enemies further away, and the charge-up drilling will also damage enemies close to the Ride Armor. Dashing is possible while charging.</p>

  <h5>Hawk Ride Armor (H-Type)</h5>
  <p>This is the only Ride Armor with flight capabilities (hold down JUMP in the air to hover, which runs on a fuel meter that recharges after landing). It lacks a punch, instead firing two fast moving missiles that travel straight ahead and deal two damage each. It only has 24 bars of life, so be careful and use the mobility to avoid powerful attacks. You can also dive bomb foes with the stomp which can be an effective tactic against grounded foes that would otherwise be difficult to hit from the air with your missiles. Note that this Ride Armor will short out and self destruct in 15 seconds if it submerges underwater.</p>

  <h5>Frog Ride Armor (F-Type)</h5>
  <p>This Ride Armor really shines in the water, where it can launch torpedos that home in on foes, as well as swim (hold down JUMP in the water to rise upwards, which runs on a fuel meter that recharges after landing). It's no slouch on the land either, where it excels at jumping, having the highest jump of all Ride Armors, and, naturally, being well suited for stomping on enemies. However its mobility on land is compromised as it cannot walk, only jump. The torpedos won't travel forward when shot on land but will still drop straight down so you can drop them on enemies below you; combine this with stomps for extra damage output. Note that this Ride Armor only has 24 bars of life, so avoid taking too much damage if you can. It also has no arms so cannot punch.</p>

  <h4>Vile MK-II</h4>
  <p>After dying as "normal" Vile, if you have 5 scrap, you can revive yourself on the spot as Vile MK II (press the Special button on the respawn screen). Vile MK II comes with improved specials: his stun shot now shoots stun missiles that deal 1 damage in addition to stunning, his rocket punch homes in on targets, his air bombs turns into a barrage of stun shots that deal 1 damage, and his napalm turns into a moving flame piller that can burn enemies and leaves behind a trail. He also gains access to an additional special move, the health-leeching grab, that can be activated with DASH + SPECIAL. If you grab a foe, you can drain up to 6 damage at the rate of 1 damage every half second, but this move can be mashed out of and leaves Vile vulnerable, so be careful. The grab's damage ignores defense boosts. Note that the grab will not work if done in a spot that would clip the victim into a wall or other obstacle.</p>
  <p>Vile MK-II also comes with a shield on his back that reduces damage from attacks from behind by 50%. It also prevents Vile from flinching from attacks from behind. If an attack deals one damage, it is blocked completely. The shield even protects Vile's back in Ride Armors. Try to take advantage of this passive trait whenever possible and turn your back to your enemies when your weapons or specials are on cooldown.</p>
  <p>As Vile MK-II, if you have 10 scrap, you can even summon the mighty Goliath Ride Armor! This armor functions similary to the N-type, except it deals more damage, has a dash punch (hold down ATTACK while dashing), and has a ranged attack (press the SPECIAL button in the mech).</p>

  <h4>Strategy/remarks</h4>
  <p>Outside of his mech, Vile has capable ranged weapons, but requires use of his special abilities to get the most damage out of them. You'll want to stun enemies and then combo them with a series of quick attacks in succession, such as a napalm + cannon blast + rocket punch, or a stun shot + napalm + vulcan burst.</p>
  <p>Inside of his mech, Vile can really shine as a "tank" type character, soaking up damage for the team and protecting allies on the front lines, while serving as a diversion and front-line brawler while your teammates can score free hits from a safe distance. Mechs are also a great counter to Zero, but less effective against Axl. Smart foes will try to target your exposed head sticking out of the cockpit seat. To counter this weakness, press down arrow to have Vile duck inside of the mech, which protects Vile's life bar. However, you cannot move when hiding like this, only punch, so expect alert foes to back up out of melee range and try to whittle down your ride armor health. You can try to counter this by popping out of your mech and shooting your stun shot to take advantage of their further range.</p>
 
<h4>X Matchup</h4>
<p>Outside of a mech, fight X players carefully. You both have primarily ranged attacks, but X can be faster, stronger and more defensive with enough armor upgrades. Try to match upgraded X armors with either Ride Armors or MK-II to keep up with his rising power level.</p>
<p>Inside of a mech, when fighting X players, prioritize ones that lack the foot parts, as they will be easier to punch and catch up to. For ones that do have them, you'll need to use the stun shot to effectively catch up to them and punch them. If an X is charging his weapon, be prepared to duck to avoid the charge shot. If an X is jumping to reach your head, you should also jump yourself to deny him those headshots that are so dangerous to Vile's HP, and then stomp down on him, or fire a stun shot, to make use of the aerial time. Jumping out of your mech, dropping bombs, and landing back in can also be an effective strategy, especially against a Hadouken-happy X, as evacuating the mech makes it immune to damage. Finally, be very careful of the Strike Chain, as if X can grapple your head, you'll get yanked straight out of the Ride Armor, and though you can summon it back, that has a 4 second cooldown. So be prepared to duck if a chain is heading your way.</p>

<h4>Zero Matchup</h4>
<p>Outside of a mech, the stun shot is most critical to prevent Zero from reflecting your shots and get in more damage. Note that Zero cannot block your stun shot.</p>
<p>Inside of a mech, you are at a major advantage; your punches will dominate Zero at melee range on the ground, whose puny sword cannot hope to overcome your mech's huge metal fists. But watch out for attacks from the air and above, as your head is vulnerable, and can even be frozen by Hyouretsuzan! If Zero attacks you from the air, try either ducking or jumping higher yourself to dodge the attacks. Remember you can aim the stunshot upwards. Zero may simply run or ignore you since you are his hardest matchup. The stunshot can help stop him in his tracks. Watch out for Raijingeki as well, as if you run into that, your Ride Armor is toast. If Black Armor Zero arrives, your melee advantage is nullified; all you can really do is spam punch and hope he's low on HP, or duck in your mech to buy time.</p> 
<h4>Vile Matchup</h4>
<p>Outside of a mech, landing the first stun shot is important. In general, whichever Vile can make better use of specials, will come out on top.</p>
<p>Inside of a mech, Vile vs Vile boils down to a few factors: who can get a stun shot in first, and who has higher Ride Armor HP when the fight starts. Try to be the first to get the stun shot in to get free punches in. Note that Vile MK-II's grab can target Ride Armor users and will immediately eject them out of the armor, so this can be a great counter to mech users.</p>

<h4>Axl Matchup</h4>
<p>Outside of a mech, Axl can still be a threat with his high headshot damage and aim flexibility. As with most matchups, try to land the initial stunshot to stop him in his tracks. Your Front Runner will be helpful for hovering Axls trying to get the height advantage over you.</p>
<p>Inside of a mech, Axl is the most dangerous threat to Ride Armor tactics. As such, consider MK-II instead if there are a lot of Axls. Your exposed head is easy pickings for well aimed Axl Bullet shots. To make matters worse, the Blast Launcher's splash damage will easily hurt both Vile and the Ride Armor's HP pool. In short, all of Axl's weapons were designed to make short work of Vile. However, Vile has ways to deal with Axl. You'd do well to duck if an Axl enters your screen. Force him to waste bullets and ammo targeting your ride armor, buying time. If you can get up close and personal to Axl, or get a height advantage over him, he will have a hard time aiming at your head as the bullets will hit your mech before reaching your head. Consider even evacuating from your mech when Axl approaches, as your additional speed will make it harder for him to hit you, or at the very least, you can outrun him more easily as you are faster outside the mech.</p>

  <h3>Axl Character Guide</h3>
  <img src="assets/images/axl.png" />
  <div class="bio" style="width:850px">
    <h4>Bio</h4>
    <p>Axl is the tritagonist of the Mega Man X series. He is a prototype of the New Generation Reploids with the unique ability to mimic the external and internal characteristics of anyone he encounters. Axl has had important roles in Mega Man X7 and X8, effectively making him the third playable protagonist of the Mega Man X series alongside Mega Man X and Zero.</p>
    <img src="assets/images/ssx4.png" />
  </div>
  <h4>Overview</h4>
  <p>Like X, Axl is a ranged character that can switch between various weapons. Unlike X however, he uses actual guns. These firearms can be aimed anywhere on the screen, and at any angle. Axl also has a unique Copy Shot ability which lets him transform into opponents, and even an assassination ability when disguised that can kill in one hit if aimed at the head.</p>
  <p>These qualities make Axl a "spy agent" type character with a specialist role on the team, using his aiming capabilities to assassinate key threats, and sneaking behind enemy lines while disguised to sabotage the objective.</p>
  
<h4>Controls</h4>
<p>Axl is an extremely customizable character from a controls perspective with 3 different aim modes. These can be changed in the Options menu, and can even be changed in the middle of a match. Below is a list of the aim modes and more info and remarks:</p>
<p>Aim Mode 1: Directional Aim</p>
<p>Also known as "8 way" aim. Push the arrow keys in the direction you want to aim, and Axl will snap his aim to that direction. Release, and Axl will reset his aim straight forward. Press up+left/right to aim diagonally up, and down+left/right to aim diagonally down. You can press the Aim Backwards binding (default LSHIFT) to have Axl point his gun backwards, good for running away while shooting a pursuer. You can also bind an "aim lock" key: if this key is bound and held, Axl will aim in place, without moving. Also in this mode, there is a separate crouch binding, which you can use if the down key is already bound to aim down. By default, these are both bound to LControl.</p>
<p>Note that if you're using a controller and bind the aim controls to an analog stick, and set the analog setting to "yes" in Settings, Axl will aim his gun at the exact angle you push the analog stick in, allowing for 360 aim, unlike with keyboard keys or a D-Pad. This makes this control scheme the optimal one for analog stick controller players.</p>

<p>Aim Mode 2: Angular Aim</p>
<p>In this mode, press the up or down key to change the angle at which Axl points his guns. (These are configurable as the "aim angle up" and "aim angle down" in the controls menu, when you have this control scheme selected.) The angle is not reset if you stop holding down these keys, but you can reset the angle to straight ahead by pressing the "aim reset" binding (default Space). As with Directional Aim, you can bind crouch to a separate key to prevent conflict with the down key, as well as Aim Backwards and Aim Lock.</p>

<p>Aim Mode 3: Cursor Aim</p>
<p>This aim mode involves moving a cursor on the screen, and allows you to play Axl with a mouse, much like a third person shooter. By default you use WASD for movement, Space to jump, and Left Shift to crouch. The cursor can be moved with mouse or the Axl aim bindings in Controls menu. For the mode's keyboard controls, this control scheme has its own control binding in the controls menu, "Keyboard (Axl Cursor)". Note that you can use this mode with a controller as well, but it'll use the controller binding instead</p>

<h4>Weapons</h4>
<p><i>Note:</i> all of Axl's weapons run on ammo, but unlike X, they regenerate over time.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/axl_bullets_icon.png"/> Axl Bullets</p>
<ul>
  <li>Damage: 1 (1.5 per headshot)</li>
  <li>Ammo: 1 per shot</li>
  <li>Cooldown: 0.15</li>
</ul>
<p>Axl's standard, trusty handgun. It's capable of rapid fire shots (hold down the shoot button). Right click/special button will shoot a Copy Shot. Copy Shots deal 2x damage of a normal Axl Bullet shot but lack auto-fire capabilities and cost more ammo. Headshots are also possible and deal 50% more damage.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/blast_launcher_icon.png"/> Blast Launcher</p>
<ul>
  <li>Damage: 2 (Explosion: 4)</li>
  <li>Ammo: 4 per shot (8 charged)</li>
  <li>Cooldown: 0.75 (1.5 charged)</li>
</ul>
<p>A powerful grenade launcher. The grenades are affected by gravity and will bounce off walls, and will blow up after 2 seconds. Special button with the weapon fires the "Explosion" shot, a fast energy rocket that blows up immediately on impact with walls. Do note that as a 2-handed weapon, Axl cannot climb walls or shoot from ladders when wielding it, nor can he aim it backwards like with the Axl Bullets. When climbing walls or ladders with this weapon, Axl will instead temporarily switch to the Axl Bullet. Axl also cannot dash while using it (but he can still jump/hover).</p>  
<p>Both grenades and the rocket will cause significant knockback to enemies. They will also cause self damage to the Axl who shot them if he is in the blast range, so be careful. However, you can use the knockback to your advantage and perform a Grenade or Rocket jump! However, this is high risk and requires quite a bit of skill.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/raygun_icon.png"/> Ray Gun</p>
<ul>
  <li>Damage: 1 per hit</li>
  <li>Ammo: 1 per shot</li>
  <li>Cooldown: 0.1</li>
</ul>
<p>This sci-fi handgun rapidly shoots slow-moving, team-colored lasers that can pass through enemies. Hold down the fire button for automatic fire, which can create a continuous beam if Axl is stationary. SPECIAL button with the weapon shoots lasers that can't pass through enemies, but instead ricochet off walls and travel further.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/doublebullet_icon.png"/> Double Bullet</p>
<ul>
  <li>Damage: 1 per hit</li>
  <li>Ammo: 1 per shot</li>
  <li>Cooldown: 0.075</li>
</ul>
<p>Only obtainable when White Axl is activated, where it replaces the standard Axl Bullet. It's a dual wielded pair of Axl Bullets. As Axl fires two pistols, the fire rate is double that of the normal Axl Bullets, so you can barrage enemies with a hailstorm of gunfire, but keep in mind that as a two handed weapon, you can't climb walls with it active.</p>

<h4>Abilities</h4>
<p><b>Copy Shot</b></p>
<p>With the Axl Bullet equipped, you can shoot Copy Shots with Right Mouse or SPECIAL button on controller. These deal more damage, but more notably, killing someone with the shot grants you their "DNA Core" in your weapon slot inventory. Switch to the DNA Core and press the shoot button to transform into that opponent, copying their name and equipped weapons/amor at their time of death! Up to 4 transformations can be stored in your inventory, and they are not lost on death. You can also preview a transformation's attributes such as the weapons, armor, ammo levels, etc with SPECIAL button with a transformation selected, before applying it.</p>
<p>When you activate a transformation, all your Axl weapon ammo will be replenished. While transformed as a character, you can use all abilities of that character, though the KBM controls are not rebound. You will also get two additional weapon slots: an Assassination slot and an Undisguise slot. Select the former and fully charge it up and release it on an unsuspecting enemy to deal 8 damage, or an instant kill if aimed for the head. Note that the headshot ignores any defense modifiers a character may have, and thus will always kill, except on players in invincibility states. This move will undisguise Axl once shot, and can be only held at 1 second of max charge before being automatically released. Select the latter and use it to transform back into Axl immediately.</p>
<p>In team modes, Copy Shot behavior is a little more special. You actually disguise as the player you killed, along with their team color! Use this ability to get behind enemy lines, capture the objective, and assassinate prime targets, without being noticed.</p>
<p><b>White Axl</b></p>
<p>This is a hyper mode much like Black Zero. Activate with 10 scrap by charging up the Copy Shot. White Axl gains the Double Bullet weapon and can hover until the mode runs out after 10 seconds. White Axl also has unlimited ammo and is immune to self damage with the Blast Launcher.</p>
<p><b>Hover</b></p>
<p>Axl can hover in the air for a short period of time. Simply press and hold the Jump key while airborne. This is great for launching grenades from above without worrying about damaging yourself, as well as more easily scoring headshots.</p>
<p><b>Dodge Roll</b></p>
<p>Axl can perform a combat roll by dashing while crouching. This move grants invincibility frames for its duration and is great for getting behind enemies, but has a cooldown, so be careful as it can leave you vulnerable once the roll animation ends.</p>

<h4>Strategy/remarks</h4>
<p>As you'd expect from a former Red Alert assassin, Axl is a character that specializes in infiltration, sabotage, and eliminating key threats. His ability to aim his shots anywhere on the screen at range (unlike X) make him quite effective at taking out foes causing major issues for the team, such as Vile players in Ride Armors (who are easily dispatched as all hits to Vile in the Mech count as headshots). In objective modes, use his Copy Shot ability to sneak behind enemy lines. Try to act like the enemy team while disguised, while making your way to the objective. Assassinate key threats causing trouble for the team, such as Viles in Ride Armors, Golden X's, etc.</p>
<p>In FFA modes, Axl can also be devastating in the hands of a skilled aimer, able to pick off opponents with ease. Your Copy Shot is great not only for getting kills, but for the ammo refills it provides during the transformation.</p>
<p>Axl, however, is not without his weaknesses. He does require a lot of skill, aim and multitasking to play and is not recommended for beginners. Zero will give you a lot of trouble as his Guard ability will reflect all of your bullets; you'll need to shoot at him at the head or from behind. As a ranged specialist, Axl has trouble with melee attackers that can quickly close the distance due to Axl's minimum range (he can't hit enemies too close). He is also quite frail and has no way to upgrade his defenses or reduce damage. However, Axl is lethal in the hands of a master, and player skill can make up for most of his weaknesses.</p>

<h4>X Matchup</h4>
<p>X can be a tough target to hit with Axl Bullets if he has the foot parts and dashes and jumps around a lot, as he's small and fast. The Blast Launcher is also an easier weapon to land hits with on X as well, and is more effective if X has a Rolling Shield up. If X is using the Max chest armor, he'll be able to significantly reduce damage from your rapid fire options, so focus on damaging him with Blast Launcher explosions and slow, deliberatly aimed copy shot headshots instead, waiting for the barrier to fade before firing another shot. If you do this, you can bypass his barrier completely. Alternatively, simply hit him in the head with an assassin's bullet, which will immediately eliminate him before his barrier can kick in. The assassination is also effective for dealing with Golden X's causing trouble, bypassing his head chip healing completely.</p>

<h4>Zero Matchup</h4>
<p>If a Zero puts up a guard, all of your gunshots except Explosion (charged Blast Launcher) will be reflected. However, you can aim at his head with Axl Bullets, which his sword does not cover against. If a Zero is distracted fighting someone else, Axl will have a much easier time getting potshots off, especially if Zero is not facing you and using laggy techniques like Raijingeki or the three sword ground combo.</p> 
<h4>Vile Matchup</h4>
<p>Vile in Ride Armors can be dispatched with good aim, as all shots to Vile count as headshots when he is commanding a mech. If you copy a Vile, you can't calldown or ride mechs, but you have access to all of his abilities. Fire stun shots and switch back to Axl to get free shots on them while they're stunned.</p>

<h4>Axl Matchup</h4>
<p>Whoever aims their shots better and can land more headshots will prevail. Note that you can copy shot an Axl just like any other character, though it doesn't provide any additional effects or abilities, aside from Assassination.</p>
